## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution for this front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). This was my second challenge from this site, you can check-out my [first solution](https://github.com/ThurzinRB/faq-accordion-card-main).


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this interactive pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)

### What i've learned

As it happens for almost every project i've improved my HTML, JS and CSS skills. My biggest challenge was making the slider because it's my first time building one and making it interacts with the other elements. The toggle was pretty fun to make as i didn't have to research a lot to make. I gave a special attencion on the animations, so my project differs from the other solutions.
